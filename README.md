# Barbell-Math

**Barbell math is hard for everyone. Stop puzzling over whether you've loaded the correct number of plates onto the bar. Just enter the weight you want to lift in kilos or pounds and youâ€™ll get a breakdown of how many of each kind of weight plate you'll need.**

**Bonus: you'll also gain some perspective on your lifting prowess by having it expressed as a quantity of cats.**
