# Barbell-Math

**Barbell math is hard for everyone. Stop puzzling over whether you've loaded the correct number of plates onto the bar. Just enter the weight you want to lift in kilos or pounds and youâ€™ll get a breakdown of how many of each kind of weight plate you'll need.**

**Bonus: you'll also gain some perspective on your lifting prowess by having it expressed as a quantity of cats.**

## About
Barbell-Math is a calculator that determines the quantities of various plates needed to load a barbell to a specified weight. This app is available for download in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/barbell-math/id1576083820).

## Features
- **Bar Selection:** Choose from standard bar sizes.
- **Unit Conversion:** Input weight in either kilos or pounds.
- **Weight Calculation:** Get a detailed breakdown of the required plates.
- **History:** Access previous calculations for quick reference.
- **Fun Extra:** See your lifting weight expressed in a real-world equivalent (the number of cats) for deepening intuitive understanding of the weight. One "standard cat" is approximately 9lbs.
